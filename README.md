## babel-ai-style-plugin

This plugin is just an experimental and funny experience for me. and it won't be a real babel plugin.


## What's going to happen

find these kinda variables from any js file replace with nothing then turns it into a css file by chatGPT API.

``` js
const style = `style=${'I need a block with background blue'}`
```
